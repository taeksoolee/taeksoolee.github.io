## 오류
  docker 오류

  This system has been minimized by removing packages and content that are
  not required on a system that users do not log into.

  To restore this content, including manpages, you can run the 'unminimize'
  command. You will still need to ensure the 'man-db' package is installed.
<code>
$ unminimize
$ apt update && yes | unminimize
</code>
